# Writing Kubernetes Operators in Java with JOSDK, Part 5: Dependent Resources

[Java Operator SDK](https://javaoperatorsdk.io), or JOSDK, is an open source project that aims to simplify the task of
creating Kubernetes Operators using Java. The project was started
by [Container Solutions](https://container-solutions.com), and Red Hat is now a major contributor. Moreover, it now
lives under the [Operator Framework umbrella](https://github.com/operator-framework), which is a [Cloud
Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://cncf.io) incubating project.

The [first article in this series](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/02/15/write-kubernetes-java-java-operator-sdk)
introduced JOSDK and explained why it could be interesting to create Operators in Java. The
[second article](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/03/22/write-kubernetes-java-java-operator-sdk-part-2)
showed how
the [JOSDK Quarkus extension `quarkus-operator-sdk`](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-operator-sdk), also called
QOSDK, facilitates the development experience by taking care of managing the Custom Resource Definition
automatically.
The [third article](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/04/04/writing-kubernetes-operators-java-josdk-part-3-implementing-controller)
focused on what's required to implement the reconciliation logic, while 
[part four](**** TODO: INSERT LINK TO PART 4****)
focused on updating the code to use recent versions of Quarkus, JOSDK and QOSDK.

## Where things stand

Your updated Operator exposes your application outside the cluster via an `Ingress`, creating the
associated `Deployment` and `Service` along the way. However, while this simplified exposing the application, you
still need to know **where** to access the application or how to find that information! Similarly, it might take
some time for the cluster to achieve the desired state. In the mean time, users are left wondering if things are
working correctly.

If you recall properly, you added labels to the components your Operator created. While you could indeed use these
labels to check on the status of your application and its components, wouldn't it be nicer if you could simply
interact with the API we created? Our goal, developing this Operator, is, after all, to simplify interacting with the
clusterâ€¦ From this perspective, your Operator only fulfills one part of its contract because it doesn't properly
encapsulates the complexity of dealing with the cluster. How could you fix this problem?

For reference, here is the
[code as it stands](https://github.com/halkyonio/exposedapp-rhdblog/tree/part-4) after part 4.

## Adding a status to your custom resource

Remember that when we discussed how to model custom resources (CR), we mentioned that JOSDK enforces the best
practice of separating desired from actual state, each materialized by separate CR fields: `spec` and `status`
respectively. Your Operator currently appropriately models the desired state by extracting the information specified by
the user in the `spec` field. It does not, however, report the actual state of the cluster, which is the second part
of its contract. That's where the `status` field comes into play.

For reference, here's the
[updated code](https://github.com/halkyonio/exposedapp-rhdblog/tree/part-3-updated)
after the updates performed in the previous section.

If you haven't started your Operator using the Quarkus Dev mode, please do so again (`mvn quarkus:dev` or `quarkus
dev` if you've installed the [Quarkus CLI](https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling)).

You're going to add two `host` and `message` String fields to your `ExposedAppStatus` class, which we leave as an
exercise to you, also adding a constructor taking both parameters for good measure (note that you'll still need a
default constructor for serialization purposes).

If the `Ingress` resource has properly been created by your Operator and its status indicates that it has been
properly handled by the associated controller, you'll update the `message` field to state that the application is
indeed exposed and put the associated host name to the `host` field. Otherwise, you'll simply set the message to
"processing" to let the user know that the `ExposedApp` CR has indeed been taken into account. You'll then simply
return `UpdateControl.updateStatus` passing it your CR with the updated status to let JOSDK know that it needs to
send the status change to the cluster. Replace the `return UpdateControl.noUpdate();` line in your `reconcile`
method by:

```java,noformat
    final var maybeStatus = ingress.getStatus();
    final var status = Optional.ofNullable(maybeStatus).map(s -> {
        var result = DEFAULT_STATUS;
        final var ingresses = s.getLoadBalancer().getIngress();
        if (ingresses != null && !ingresses.isEmpty()) {
            // only set the status if the ingress is ready to provide the info we need
            var ing = ingresses.get(0);
            String hostname = ing.getHostname();
            final var url = "https://" + (hostname != null ? hostname : ing.getIp());
            log.info("App {} is exposed and ready to used at {}", name, url);
            result = new ExposedAppStatus("exposed", url);
        }
        return result;
    }).orElse(DEFAULT_STATUS);

    exposedApp.setStatus(status);
    return UpdateControl.updateStatus(exposedApp);
```

where `DEFAULT_STATUS` is a constant declared as:

```java
private static final ExposedAppStatus DEFAULT_STATUS = new ExposedAppStatus("processing", null);
```

Once that's done, if you already have an `ExposedApp` on your cluster / namespace, please either modify or re-create
it so that you can observe the new behavior of your Operator.

NOTE: It is important to make sure your Operator is running if you delete your CR. By default, JOSDK configures
controllers to automatically add a generated
[finalizer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/) to the CRs they handle
so that the controller has a chance to perform any cleaning operation it might need before the resource is actually
deleted. Resources with finalizers are therefore deleted only when all their finalizers are removed by
the controllers that added them, thus signaling to Kubernetes that all controllers are OK with the resource being
deleted. Of course, a controller can only agree to the resource deletion if it is running. Attempting to delete a
resource with a finalizer, associated with a non-running controller, will thus block the deletion until that
controller can signal whether that deletion is acceptable. See the
[JOSDK documentation](https://javaoperatorsdk.io/docs/getting-started) for more details on how it handles
[finalizers](https://javaoperatorsdk.io/docs/features#finalizer-support).

Once the CR is updated or re-created, you'll notice, however, that, wait as you may, the logging message you'd
expect to see, that your application has correctly been exposed, never occurs. Examine your CR (called
`hello-quarkus` in the precedent parts) using:

```shell
kubectl describe exposedapps.halkyon.io hello-quarkus
```

You should get the following result:

```shell
Name:         hello-quarkus
Namespace:    default
...
Status:
  Message:  processing
...
```

However, unless there's a problem with your cluster setup (such as missing an Ingress controller), if you wait long
enough (usually a matter of a dozen of seconds), you can easily verify that your application is indeed exposed by
examining the `Ingress` resource your Operator created and looking at its status:

```shell
kubectl get ingress hello-quarkus -o jsonpath='{.status}'
```

which should give you something similar to:

```json
{"loadBalancer":{"ingress":[{"ip":"192.168.1.15"}]}}
```

You can confirm that your application is indeed available at the given address (in our case, opening
https://192.168.1.15/hello should return the expected greeting message).

Depending on the timing of operations on your cluster, it is very likely that the `Ingress` wasn't ready when your
controller got called so the status field did not have the information you were looking for at that time. You could
loop over some amount of time to hope to catch the status in the right state but that is not the proper way to deal
with this issue. How can you deal with this issue?

Let's step back a little. Remember that Kubernetes is built around the notion that controllers are in charge of a
given resource kind, that is a controller listens for events pertaining to a specific kind of resources and deal
with these as they come. By default, then controllers only worry about one kind of resources: the one they're
supposed to handle. This is also the case for JOSDK and QOSDK: by default, your controller is associated with its
primary resource kind (usually, your Custom Resource, `ExposedApp` in this example). The behavior you're seeing is
therefore completely expected.

However, it is often the case that a controller needs to also reconcile their primary resources whenever events
occur on other secondary/dependent resources associated with the primary resources. For example, the `Deployment`
controller needs to be informed whenever events occur on associated `Pods` so that it can react accordingly. In your
sample Operator, your controller needs to be notified of `Ingress` (a secondary resource) events so that it can
update the associated `ExposedApp` (primary resource) accordingly.

JOSDK takes care of this problem by introducing the
[event source concept](https://javaoperatorsdk.io/docs/features#handling-related-events-with-event-sources).
An event source (an implementation of the`EventSource` interface in JOSDK) represents a source of events that can
somehow be mapped to a CR with the purpose of triggering the associated controller. Whenever the `EventSource`
triggers an event, it needs to do so in such a way that it identifies which CR is supposed to be associated with
that event so that JOSDK can trigger the related controller.

For the `ExposedApp` controller, you want an event source associated with `Ingress` resources. Ideally, you'd want
to only get events related to `Ingress` resources that were created by our controller, not all `Ingress` resources
that might exist in the cluster as you don't really care about them, which you can accomplish by filtering these
events based on a [label selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/). By
associating such an event source to your controller, JOSDK will take care of calling your controller whenever events
occur on secondary resources associated with your primary `ExposedApp` resources.

In order to be able to filter events, you will add the recommended `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by` label to the
secondary resources managed by your controller by modifying your `reconcile` method to add that label to the
`labels` map that is passed to the `createMetadata` method:

```java
final var labels=Map.of(
        APP_LABEL, exposedApp.getMetadata().getName(),
        MANAGED_BY_KEY, MANAGED_BY_VALUE);
```

where `MANAGED_BY_KEY` and `MANAGED_BY_VALUE` are defined as follows, also defining the `MANAGED_BY_SELECTOR` you
will use to filter the events at the same time:

```java
static final String MANAGED_BY_KEY = "app.kubernetes.io/managed-by";
static final String MANAGED_BY_VALUE = "exposedapp-controller";
static final String MANAGED_BY_SELECTOR = MANAGED_BY_KEY + "=" + MANAGED_BY_VALUE;
```

JOSDK provides
[several `EventSource` implementations](https://javaoperatorsdk.io/docs/features#built-in-eventsources) out of the
box to cover common use cases, some dealing with watching events on Kubernetes resources but also ones meant to
allow controllers to react to events happening outside of the cluster, which is a really powerful feature.

Let's start with a very low-level event source implementation so that you can take a peak at how JOSDK handles
events. You will implement an `EventSource` based on a
[Fabric8 client `Watcher`](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/main/kubernetes-client-api/src/main/java/io/fabric8/kubernetes/client/Watcher.java):

```java
public static class IngressEventSource implements EventSource, Watcher<Ingress> {
    private EventHandler handler;

    @Override
    public void eventReceived(Action action, Ingress ingress) {
        final var status = ingress.getStatus();
        if (status != null) {
            final var ingressStatus = status.getLoadBalancer().getIngress();
            if (!ingressStatus.isEmpty()) {
                ResourceID.fromFirstOwnerReference(ingress).ifPresent(resourceID -> handler.handleEvent(new Event(resourceID)));
            }
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onClose(WatcherException e) {
    }

    @Override
    public void setEventHandler(EventHandler eventHandler) {
        this.handler = eventHandler;
    }

    @Override
    public void start() throws OperatorException {

    }

    @Override
    public void stop() throws OperatorException {

    }
}
```

Let's look at the details. First, quite logically, your `EventSource` needs to implement the
[`EventSource` interface](https://github.com/operator-framework/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/operator-framework-core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/processing/event/source/EventSource.java)
which means that you have to implement 3 methods: `setEventHandler` (the only one we care about here), `start` and
`stop`, these last two being only useful if you need to have code that runs whenever the associated reconciler
starts or stops, which you don't need to worry about here. The `setEventHandler` method will be called automatically
by the SDK when your event source gets registered. JOSDK will call it, providing an
[`EventHandler`](https://github.com/operator-framework/java-operator-sdk/blob/main/operator-framework-core/src/main/java/io/javaoperatorsdk/operator/processing/event/EventHandler.java)
instance that your event source can use to ask JOSDK to potentially trigger your reconciler.
Typically, you only need to record that instance so that your event source can refer to it when needed. Note that
all this is fairly common to all `EventSource` implementations and, recognizing this, JOSDK provides an
`AbstractEventSource` class that takes care of these details.

Next, your event source needs to implement the `Watcher` interface, meaning that the Fabric8 client will call your
`EventSource` `eventReceived` method whenever an event, that matches your `Watcher` configuration, occurs for `Ingress`
events. You want to trigger the reconciler only if the `Ingress` has a status and that it contains the information
you need to extract the address at which the application will be exposed (which can be extracted from the
`status.loadBalancer.ingress` field, as you saw above).

Assuming this condition is satisfied, you then need to identify which of your CRs should be
associated with that event so that the SDK can retrieve it and trigger your reconciler with it. In this case,
remember that you added an owner reference to your secondary resources in Part 3. The owner reference records the
identifier of the primary resource with which the secondary resource is associated. That's what you will use here,
creating a `ResourceID` using `ResourceID.fromFirstOwnerReference`. Assuming an owner reference is found, we can now
call the `EventHandler`.

Finally, you need some way to tell JOSDK about your event source. This is done by making your reconciler implement
the `EventSourceInitializer` interface, parameterized using the class of your primary resource (`ExposedApp`). This,
in turn, means you need to implement the
`public Map<String, EventSource> prepareEventSources(EventSourceContext<ExposedApp> eventSourceContext)` method. A
reconciler can (and very often does, though this is not the case in this simple example) require several event
sources to get notified whenever events occur that it needs to handle. `prepareEventSources` is the method JOSDK
uses is to learn which event sources your reconciler requires, each associated with a unique name identifying it
(which is why the method returns a `Map`).

In your case, you still need to do two things. First, tell Fabric8 to start watching `Ingress` events, but
only the ones that match the specified label selector you defined earlier, letting it know
that it should call your event source. To do this, implement the following method:

```java
  public static IngressEventSource create(KubernetesClient client) {
        final var eventSource = new IngressEventSource();
        final var options = new ListOptionsBuilder().withLabelSelector(MANAGED_BY_SELECTOR).build();
        client.network().v1().ingresses().watch(options ,eventSource);
        return eventSource;
    }
```

The second thing you need to do is to implement the `prepareEventSources` method, returning a named instance of your
`IngressEventSource` class, as follows, retrieving the Fabric8 client instance you need from the
`EventSourceContext` instance provided by JOSDK when the method gets called:

```java
    @Override
    public Map<String, EventSource> prepareEventSources(EventSourceContext<ExposedApp> eventSourceContext) {
        return Map.of("ingress-event-source", IngressEventSource.create(eventSourceContext.getClient()));
    }
```

That should do it. If you left your Operator running using Quarkus Dev Mode while writing the code, it should
restart and, if you delete your CR and re-create it, after a while, you should see more logging happening in the
console, seeing that your reconciler is actually called several times, each time an event, that the SDK thinks might
be of interest, happens. After a few seconds, the condition you're waiting for should happen and the reconciler
should log the address at which your app is now available. If you check your CR, using

```shell
kubectl describe exposedapps.halkyon.io
```

you should see something similar to:

```shell
Name:         hello-quarkus
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>
API Version:  halkyon.io/v1alpha1
Kind:         ExposedApp
Metadata:
  Creation Timestamp:  2023-08-26T15:47:15Z
  Generation:          1
  Resource Version:    15120950
  UID:                 7e08e5d6-4830-4d5b-b412-430b33f3c432
Spec:
  Image Ref:  quay.io/metacosm/hello:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
Status:
  Host:     exposed
  Message:  https://192.168.1.15
Events:     <none>
```

That was quite a bit of work, even though JOSDK takes care of lots of the details already. However, this code
leaves a lot to desire in terms of error handling, for example. Luckily, JOSDK provides an `EventSource`
implementation that is optimized to handle Kubernetes resources, based on Fabric8's
[`SharedInformer`](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/main/doc/CHEATSHEET.md#sharedinformers) which
implements many commonly used patterns and optimizations so that you can focus on your
controller's logic: [InformerEventSource](https://javaoperatorsdk.io/docs/features#informereventsource).

All the work you did above could be replaced by only the following code:

```java
@Override
public Map<String,EventSource> prepareEventSources(EventSourceContext<ExposedApp> eventSourceContext) {
    final var config = InformerConfiguration.from(Ingress.class).withLabelSelector(MANAGED_BY_SELECTOR).build();
    return EventSourceInitializer.nameEventSources(new InformerEventSource<>(config, eventSourceContext));
}
```

even asking JOSDK to generate a name automatically for your event source. The only thing that's needed is to
configure it to listen to `Ingress` events, matching the desired label selector, using:
`InformerConfiguration.from(Ingress.class).withLabelSelector(MANAGED_BY_SELECTOR).build()`.

## Conclusion

This concludes part 5 of our series. You have implemented status handling in your Operator, scratching the surface of 
what can be accomplished using event sources so that your Operator can react to multiple, varied conditions, both 
affecting Kubernetes resources but also, though this didn't get covered here, external resources.

You implemented an `EventSource` from scratch first and then used one of the powerful bundled implementations,
`InformerEventSource` optimized to deal with common patterns used when dealing with Kubernetes resources. However,
your reconciler is still very simple and doesn't deal very well with error conditions and is not optimized as the
secondary resources it needs are always created and sent to the cluster even though this isn't always needed. In the
next part, we will see how JOSDK could help with this situation.
